## in this task we were suppose to go in and make rafactors to make it look more of a modern HTMl layout that has elements and sematics. 

In this project throughout the code we had a lot of the elements and sematics that were just named DIV. Though it is not wrong to just use DIV it does not look organized to others and could get confusing later on. The other problems I faced in the project was in the CSS we had a lot of codes that were repeated. You can condensed a majority of the codes into one class.
